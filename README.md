## Description 📃
**Movie App** is a  website built with **React & Redux** 

**Movie App** is my first React project (that's why it's not perfect 😄), it uses **TMDB API** that provides you with lots of data about Tv shows and movies. 

**The main dashboard** shows you the navigation on the left, **where you can navigate to home or movie or tv** etc...

each page has its own data where you can see **most popular movies or top-rated movies and there is a see-all button that navigates you to  another page where you can see the full list of which ever category you choose** (top movies, trending, etc...)

**when clicking on a movie or tv show it will show you the full details** like release data, director, actors, and rating and also you can see the full official trailer **and in the bottom there is a section for similar shows to the one you chose.**



## Developing Details 🧑‍💻

The website was built with **React for the UI and React Router for the routing and also Tankstack Query that made fetching data easy and kept the code clean and for styling Tailwind**.

I also used **Redux** to manage the state but actually, I didn't really have a lot of states that need to be shared among different components, but the good thing **whenever I need to scale or add more features to the site, it will be good to use redux because it already configured.**
